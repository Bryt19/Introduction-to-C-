**C++** (pronounced "C plus plus" and sometimes abbreviated as **CPP**) is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist **Bjarne Stroustrup**. It first appeared in **1985** as an extension of the **C programming language** and has since evolved significantly.

Here are some key points about C++:

1. **Multi-Paradigm**: C++ supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, imperative, functional, object-oriented, and generic programming.

2. **Features**: Over time, C++ has gained object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

3. **Compiled Language**: C++ is almost always implemented as a compiled language. Many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.

4. **Design Highlights**:
   - **Systems Programming**: C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software in mind.
   - **Performance and Efficiency**: It emphasizes performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use.
   - **Large Systems**: C++ is suitable for large-scale software development.

5. **Applications**:
   - **Desktop Applications**: C++ is commonly used for desktop applications.
   - **Video Games**: It is a popular language in game development.
   - **Servers**: C++ powers servers for e-commerce, web search, databases, and more.
   - **Performance-Critical Applications**: It has been used in telephone switches and space probes.

6. **Standardization**: C++ is standardized by the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**. The latest standard version, **C++20**, was ratified and published in December 2020.

7. **History**: Bjarne Stroustrup developed C++ at Bell Labs starting in 1979. He wanted a language similar to C but with high-level features for program organization.

In summary, C++ is a versatile language with a rich history, widely used in various domains due to its performance, flexibility, and extensive features¹².
